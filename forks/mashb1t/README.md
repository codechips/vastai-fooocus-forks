## Model Provisioning

This template includes an advanced provisioning system that automatically downloads your models on startup:

1. Create a TOML configuration file with your models
2. Host it on GitHub, Google Drive, or any web server
3. Set `PROVISION_URL` to your config file URL
4. Models download automatically when the instance starts

Example configuration:
```toml
[models.checkpoints]
sdxl-base = { source = "huggingface", repo = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", file = "sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors" }

[models.lora]
detail-enhancer = { source = "civitai", model_id = "135867" }
```

See [PROVISION.md](https://github.com/codechips/vastai-fooocus-forks/blob/main/PROVISION.md) for complete documentation.
